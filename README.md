# Breaking Out of WASM with Zig

A simple example, inspired by the classic game breakout, demonstrating how to make a game using zig-javascript-bridge.

Really the gameplay is mostly intended to be like Brickles Plus (https://emulate-in-browser.macintoshrepository.org/?macmodel=3&disk1=MacOS71.dsk&disk2=5753_Brickles-Plus-v3.1.dsk) which is the version I played as a young kid.
